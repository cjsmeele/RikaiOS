OS-STD
======

This directory contains the headers of the operating system standard library,
used both by the operating system kernel and by userland.

Somewhat similar to the C++ standard library, the code in this library is not
meant to be easily understandable, but must provide an easy-to-grasp interface
for programmers exposed to the basics of the C++ standard library (e.g.
interactions with std::string, std::vector and cmath).

All os-std types and functions are contained in the `ostd' namespace.
